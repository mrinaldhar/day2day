Day 2 Day app for App-a-thon

This repository contains the source code for the app we developed for Socionity App-a-thon 2014.

It's called "Day 2 Day" because its meant to present the user with all the stuff that he would need everyday.

Weather, News, Reminders, Maps, among other stuff can be accessed by just swiping across the relevant option.

This app runs on android and has been successfully tested on Samsung Galaxy S4.
